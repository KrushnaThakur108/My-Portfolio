    <h3>
      <p>
        Hey there! I’m Krushna Thakur, a BSc (Hons.) Computer Science and Game Development student at Backstage Pass Institute of Gaming and Technology — where I’m shaping my passion for games, technology, and art into real-world skills.
      </p>

    </h3>


    <h2>I wear many creative hats:</h2>


    <h4>
      <ul>
        <li>🎨 A self-taught 2D artist,</li>
        <li>🧊 A growing 3D creator learning Blender and animation tools,</li>
        <li>💻 A dedicated full-stack web developer in training,</li>
        <li>👨‍💻 A programmer fluent in Python, and currently mastering C and C++,</li>
        <li>🤖 An explorer of automation, scripting, and emerging tech like AI and game engines.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
    What drives me is the curiosity to learn, the courage to try, and the consistency to keep showing up — as proven when I was selected as one of the finalists in the FrameDrop Art Showdown at BSP, recognized for being the most consistent participant.
    This portfolio is more than just a showcase — it’s a timeline of my growth, my commitment to creativity, and the dream to build amazing things, from websites and games to animations and stories.
    I believe that art and code aren’t separate — they’re two sides of the same creation. And I’m here to master both.
    Let’s build the future — one pixel and one line of code at a time.
