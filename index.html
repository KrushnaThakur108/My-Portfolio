   <h2>👋 Hey there! I'm Krushna Thakur</h2> 
      <h3>
         <p>I'm a BSc (Hons.) Computer Science and Game Development student at Backstage Pass Institute of Gaming and Technology, where creativity meets code. 
            A passionate full-stack web development learner, a 2D artist stepping into the 3D world, and a tech explorer with a mission to build, design, and animate digital experiences.
            My journey is powered by curiosity and consistency. I’ve been one of the shortlisted finalists of the FrameDrop event at BSP, 
            recognized not just for creativity, but for being the most consistent participant throughout. I thrive in environments where art, tech, and imagination collide.
