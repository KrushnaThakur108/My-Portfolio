<h1>THE BEST MOVIES AND DRAMAS I WATCHED !</h1>

<h2>MY TOP 3 MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h2>

<hr/>
<hr/>

<h3>1. "3 Idiots" </h3>
    <p>One of the best movies I’ve ever watched — and trust me, I’ve watched it more than 8–9 times! 3 Idiots, starring Aamir Khan, isn’t just a movie — it’s an eye-opener. It teaches you that passion, skills, and true interest matter more than chasing fame or society's expectations. Every time I watch it, I feel inspired to follow what I truly love.
    If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on something life-changing. Go watch it — highly recommended from the heart!<br/>
    IMDB : 8.4/10 <br/>

<h3>2. "Mission Mangal" </h3>
    <p>This movie left me speechless. Mission Mangal is not just about space or science — it's about dreams, dedication, failure, and rising again. I’ve watched it multiple times, and every single time, it fills me with pride and emotion.
    What touched me deeply is how a group of Indian scientists — especially the women — fought against all odds, limitations, and personal struggles to make India's Mars mission a reality. It made me believe that no dream is too big if you have the courage and the heart to pursue it.
    I highly recommend Mission Mangal to everyone. It’s not just a film — it’s a powerful reminder that “nothing is impossible if your intention is strong.”
    Watch it. Feel it. And let it inspire you the way it inspired me.<br/>
    IMDB : 6.6/10 <br/>

    </p>

<h3>3. "Kung Fu Hustle" </h3>
    <p>Kung Fu Hustle is pure madness — in the best way possible! I’ve watched this film again and again, and every time, it blows my mind with its mix of action, comedy, and deep life lessons hidden beneath the chaos.
    What I truly love about this movie is how it shows that true strength doesn’t come from power or status, but from within — from purpose, pain, and transformation. The journey of the main character from a nobody to a true master hit me emotionally.
    This movie is a must-watch if you love martial arts, storytelling, and something that’s totally unique. It's funny, powerful, emotional, and unforgettable.
    Kung Fu Hustle isn’t just entertainment — it’s a full experience. Highly, highly recommended! <br/>
    IMDB : 7.7/10 <br/>

<h2>MY TOP 3 ASIAN DRAMAS I WATCHED !</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>1. "The Golden Spoon" </h3>
    <p>I honestly didn’t expect The Golden Spoon to hit me so hard — but wow, it did. I’ve watched a lot of Asian dramas, but this one truly made me feel.
    The story plays with the idea of switching lives — rich vs. poor — and really makes you question what true happiness and identity mean. Would you trade your family and everything you know just to live a luxurious life? That question stayed with me throughout the show.
    I loved how it mixed suspense, emotion, family, and philosophy so beautifully. The characters felt real, their pain felt real, and the decisions they made… made me reflect on my own choices too.
    If you enjoy meaningful dramas with twists and emotion, The Golden Spoon is a must-watch. It’s not just about fantasy — it’s about truth, choices, and who we really are deep inside. Highly recommended! <br/>
    IMDB : 7.5/10 <br/>

<h3>2. "My Demon" </h3>
    <p>My Demon touched my heart in ways I can’t fully explain. As an emotional person and someone who values love, connection, and family deeply — this drama wasn’t just a fantasy-romance for me… it was an experience.
    It’s about a demon who learns to be human… and a woman who’s already carrying deep emotional wounds. But what really moved me was how love can soften even the coldest hearts and how pain can turn into healing when you find the right person beside you.
    There were moments in this drama that made me tear up — not because they were sad, but because they were beautiful. The message about fate, trust, and unconditional love hit me hard. And as someone who believes in family and deep emotional bonds, I saw myself in many of the scenes.
    My Demon is magical, yes, but it’s also about what it means to feel… to forgive… and to grow.
    If you’re someone who loves with your whole heart — please, watch this drama. It’s not just fantasy — it’s pure emotion. One of the most unforgettable dramas I’ve ever seen.
    IMDB : 7.7/10 <br/> 
    </p>

<h3>3. "Fight For My Way" </h3>
    <p>Fight For My Way is one of those dramas that stays with you long after it ends. I’ve watched many Asian dramas, but this one felt real, raw, and deeply personal. It’s not just about romance or dreams — it’s about the everyday struggle of people like you and me who dare to fight for what they truly want in life.
    The journey of the characters — especially Ko Dong-man and Choi Ae-ra — made me laugh, cry, and most importantly, believe. Believe that even when the world looks down on your dreams, even when you're constantly told you're not enough — you still keep going. You fight for your way.
    This drama gave me strength. It reminded me that it's okay to take the harder path if it means you're walking toward your true passion.
    If you ever feel lost, stuck, or underestimated — Fight For My Way will lift your spirit. I seriously recommend watching it. It’s real, inspiring, emotional, and beautiful.<br/>
    IMDB : 8.1/10 <br/>
